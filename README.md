This Project was created to manage clock-in and clock-outs occuring during Students ELP jobs!

The original system was all paper and took serious work transcribing all the hours and the notes on what each student did.

The new system would automatically digitize all the results and provide them directly to the administrators allowing for swift adn easy access to Student's employee records!

This is pretty awful code I wrote a long time ago please don't judge me
